#the Content of th repository

CodeBook.md : it indicates the variables of the tidy data set.
README.md : it explains the transformations that were done to the data.
run_analysis.R : it contains the R code to transform the data to a tidy data set.

### first upload the files

activity labels
X-TRAIN
Y-TRAIN
SUBJECT-TRAIN
X-TEST
Y-TEST
SUBJECT-TEST

### Then run the R code given which will create a tidy data set in a file named tidyset.txt


### Step-wise Transformation
STEP 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set of assignment
STEP 2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of assignment
STEP 3: Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set of assignment
STEP 4: Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names of Course Project
STEP 5: Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
